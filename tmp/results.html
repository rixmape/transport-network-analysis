<h1>Data Analysis Results</h1>
<section id="geospatial-data-preparation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geospatial-data-preparation">Geospatial Data Preparation</h2>
<p>Loads Philippine administrative boundaries and filters for the Bicol Region. Municipal names are standardized by removing suffixes and reformatting city designations.</p>
<p>What is the specific source and administrative level of the geospatial data used to define the study area’s boundaries? &gt; The dataset for Philippine subnational administrative boundaries is sourced from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform. Geodatabase is selected from the available data formats. It uses EPSG:4326 as its Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The selected layer provided geometries of cities and municipalities. The geospatial coverage is limited to the Bicol Region. The dataset is last updated on November 9, 2023. No administrative boundary changes or new city and municipality creations are recorded in the region after this date.</p>
<p>After filtering the dataset, which provinces comprise the Bicol Region, and what is the total number of municipalities and cities that form the basis of the analysis? &gt; The filtered dataset contains 6 provinces, 7 cities, and 107 municipalities. The figures are validated with the Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) database of Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).</p>
<p>What specific textual standardizations were applied to the town and city names, and why were these modifications necessary for ensuring data consistency in subsequent analyses? &gt; City names are standardized to use “City” suffix rather than “City of” prefix for consistency. Legacy names are removed, preserving only the current city and municipality names used by PSGC.</p>
<p>What are the final data schema and file format of the prepared boundaries dataset, and how does this structure facilitate its integration with other network and storm data? &gt; The final dataset has 114 rows for each city/municipality and 3 columns for the city/municipality (string), province (string), and geometry (Shapely MultiPolygon).</p>
</section>
<section id="multi-modal-transport-network-construction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multi-modal-transport-network-construction">Multi-Modal Transport Network Construction</h2>
<p>Builds a transportation network by fetching road and ferry route data from OpenStreetMap. Merges the two networks into a single graph by connecting ferry terminals to the nearest road segments within a 500-meter radius.</p>
<p>What specific OpenStreetMap (OSM) network types and tags were used to define the road and ferry systems, and what were the initial node and edge counts for each network prior to integration? &gt; OSMnx is used to build the transport network. Public and service roads (446869 nodes, 460990 edges) made up the land transport system. The “drive_service” road network type retrieves public drivable streets including service roads but excludes certain services such as parking or emergency access. The ferry routes (1087 nodes, 1060 edges) for sea transport system.</p>
<p>What was the rationale for pruning terminal ferry nodes and subsequently simplifying the merged graph, and how did these post-processing steps quantitatively impact the final number of nodes and edges in the network? &gt; The original ferry transport network contains routes with endpoints outside the Bicol Region. Pruning is necessary to preserve local routes only. After pruning terminal ferry nodes, 332 ferry nodes and 308 ferry edges remain in the ferry transport network. Note that pruning is done after network simplification.</p>
<p>What are the final node and edge counts of the resulting multi-modal transport network, and what distinct visual attributes represent the road and ferry components in the final map visualization? &gt; The integrated transport network contains 447510 nodes and 462305 edges. The simplified network contains 56932 nodes and 71895 edges. OSMnx’s edge simplification algorithm solves the curve digitization problem. It simplifies the graph’s topology by removing all nodes that are not “true” edge endpoints (i.e., intersections or dead-ends), then creating new (simplified) edges directly between those true endpoints and retaining the full geometries of the original edges as attributes on those new edges.</p>

<section id="network-accessibility-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="network-accessibility-analysis">Network Accessibility Analysis</h2>
<p>Assesses town reachability from Legazpi City. Identifies nodes reachable from the origin’s nearest node and maps towns intersecting with corresponding road and ferry segments.</p>
<p>When limited to the road network alone, which specific municipalities or provinces were identified as inaccessible from the origin point of Legazpi City? &gt; Initially, 81 cities and municipalities are accessible from Legazpi City via the road network. The entire provinces of Masbate and Catanduanes are inaccessible.</p>
<p>How did the integration of the ferry system quantitatively impact regional connectivity, and which specific towns became newly accessible as a direct result of this multi-modal approach? &gt; After merging ferry routes, 114 cities and municipalities are accessible from Legazpi City via the road and ferry network.</p>
<p>After the inclusion of ferry routes, did any towns remain inaccessible from the origin, and what might this imply about the limitations of the transport data or the network itself? &gt; After merging ferry routes, all of the cities and municipalities are now accessible.</p>
<p>What does the final accessibility map reveal about the overall pattern of regional connectivity from Legazpi City, especially concerning the transport links between mainland Bicol and its island provinces? &gt; The overall pattern is one where land-based transport ensures deep mainland connectivity, while sea-based transport provides the essential links for complete inter-province accessibility.</p>
</section>
<section id="travel-time-and-shortest-path-calculation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="travel-time-and-shortest-path-calculation">Travel Time and Shortest Path Calculation</h2>
<p>Adds travel time weights to the network using speed limits for different road categories and ferry routes. Computes the fastest routes from a central relief hub to all town centers using Dijkstra’s algorithm.</p>
<p>What specific speed limits were assigned to the different road classifications and ferry routes to enable travel time calculation, and what was the justification or source for these values? &gt; The road speed limits are taken from Republic Act No 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code which mandates the allowable speed limits on open country roads, city and municipal streets, and thoroughfares. Motor trucks and buses may travel up to 50 km/h on open country roads, 30 km/h on through streets or light-traffic city streets, and 20 km/h in crowded or hazardous areas. Meanwhile, the 17 km/h speed limit for ferry routes, sourced from Philippine Ship Spotters’ Society website, assumes older short-run vessels used on short routes between local interisland ferries.</p>
<p>What is the overall distribution of the calculated travel times from the central relief hub to all municipalities, including the minimum, maximum, and average times required for delivery? &gt; The overall distribution of travel times from the central relief hub to all municipalities shows a minimum travel time of 0.11 hours, a maximum travel time of 6.91 hours, and an average travel time of 2.76 hours. The 25th percentile is 1.59 hours, the 50th percentile (median) is 2.48 hours, and the 75th percentile is 3.95 hours.</p>
<p>Which specific towns were identified as having the fastest and slowest travel times from the relief hub, and what geographic or network characteristics explain their logistical accessibility? &gt; The towns with the slowest travel times from the relief hub are all from Masbate province, namely, Esperanza, Pio V. Corpus, Placer, Cataingan, Cawayan, while the towns with the fastest travel times are all from Albay province, namely, Legazpi City, Daraga, Santo Domingo, Camalig, Malilipot.</p>
<p>What spatial patterns do the visualized shortest path routes reveal, and how does the color gradient representing travel time illustrate the logistical challenges of reaching various parts of the Bicol Region? &gt; The spatial patterns reveal a hub-and-spoke network where travel routes radiate from a central relief center in Albay, with accessibility decreasing sharply towards the peripheries. The color gradient starkly visualizes logistical challenges, showing that travel times to island provinces (like Masbate and Catanduanes) and peninsular extremities are significantly longer due to geographic distance and reliance on slower sea transport.</p>
</section>
<section id="historical-storm-swath-generation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="historical-storm-swath-generation">Historical Storm Swath Generation</h2>
<p>Processes historical storm data from IBTrACS for tropical storms within the Philippine Area of Responsibility. Generates swaths—polygons representing storm impact areas—by buffering storm tracks based on recorded wind radii.</p>
<p>What is the source of the historical storm data, and what specific criteria, such as storm type and geographic containment within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), were applied to filter the initial dataset? &gt; The historical storm data was sourced from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) and was filtered to include only events classified as tropical storms. The initial dataset was refined to retain only storms that had at least one recorded point within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).</p>
<p>How was the hazard footprint, or “swath,” for each storm defined, and what specific data attribute was used to determine the width of this impact area? &gt; The hazard footprint, or storm swath, was generated by creating a continuous buffered polygon along the recorded track of each storm. The width of this impact area was determined by the radius of 30-knot winds, a specific data attribute provided by the Tokyo Typhoon Center for each storm record.</p>
<p>What was the final selection criterion for identifying storms that posed a direct threat to the Bicol Region, and what was the total number of unique storm events included in the final analysis? &gt; The final selection criterion was a direct spatial intersection, where only storms whose generated swaths physically overlapped with the Bicol transport network were included in the analysis. This process identified 671 unique storm events that were considered a direct threat and used for the subsequent damage simulation.</p>
<p>What does the density heatmap of historical storm tracks indicate about the spatial distribution of typhoon risk, and which specific parts of the Bicol Region are most frequently exposed to these hazards? &gt; The density heatmap of storm tracks indicates that the highest risk is concentrated along the eastern seaboard, showing a frequent west-northwest path of storms coming from the Pacific Ocean. This spatial distribution reveals that the provinces of Catanduanes, Albay, and the Camarines provinces are the most frequently exposed to these storm hazards.</p>
</section>
<section id="centrality-metrics-computation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="centrality-metrics-computation">Centrality Metrics Computation</h2>
<p>Calculates degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality for nodes, as well as edge betweenness, to identify the most critical transport network components.</p>
<p>How are degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality defined in the context of this transport network, and what does a high value for each metric signify about a town’s role or position within the system? &gt; In this transport network, degree centrality measures a node’s direct connections, betweenness centrality measures its importance as a bridge on shortest paths, and closeness centrality measures its average travel time to all other nodes. A high degree value signifies a local hub like Naga City, high betweenness indicates a critical transit corridor like Pio Duran, and high closeness reveals a strategically accessible point like Garchitorena. These metrics define a town’s specific function within the regional transport system.</p>
<p>What are the spatial patterns observed in the choropleth maps for each centrality measure, and which specific towns or provinces consistently emerge as having high degree, betweenness, and closeness? &gt; The spatial patterns show degree centrality is widely dispersed, betweenness is concentrated along the mainland’s central highway and key ports, and closeness is highest in coastal and island towns. Specific towns like Presentacion (degree), Pio Duran (betweenness), and Garchitorena (closeness) emerge as top performers in each category. Provinces like Camarines Sur and Albay are dominant in mainland-focused metrics, while Masbate leads in closeness due to its crucial sea connections.</p>
<p>Are there notable differences in the geographic distribution of the three centrality measures, and if so, what do these divergences imply about the different functional roles of various towns (e.g., a local hub vs.&nbsp;a critical corridor)? &gt; Yes, the notable geographic differences reveal distinct functional roles for towns; high degree signifies a local hub, high betweenness a critical corridor, and high closeness a strategic access point. A town with many local roads may not be vital for long-distance travel, whereas a coastal town can be a more efficient distribution point than a mainland one. This divergence means disrupting a corridor town like Pio Duran severs regional transit, while disrupting a hub has more localized consequences.</p>
<p>Which specific road or ferry segments were identified as the most critical links based on edge betweenness centrality, and what does their geographic location suggest about potential network vulnerabilities and choke points? &gt; The most critical transport links are the main north-south highway segments in towns like Ligao City (Albay) and Libmanan (Camarines Sur), and the ferry routes connecting ports like Pio Duran to Masbate. Their locations reveal significant choke points, highlighting the network’s vulnerability due to its reliance on a single mainland highway and a few maritime gateways. Damage to these specific links would effectively isolate entire provinces and cut off island communities from the mainland.</p>
</section>
<section id="network-community-detection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="network-community-detection">Network Community Detection</h2>
<p>Identifies densely connected clusters using the Louvain algorithm. Visualizes communities to reveal the transport network’s underlying structure.</p>
<p>What specific algorithm was employed to detect communities within the transport network, and what was the total number of distinct communities identified by this method? &gt; The codebase employed the multilevel (Louvain) algorithm to detect communities within the transport network, which were then visualized on a map. The program was set up to count the number of distinct communities found by this method. The analysis revealed a structure of densely connected sub-regions within the broader transport system.</p>
<p>To what extent do the detected network communities correspond with established geographic or administrative boundaries, such as provinces or islands? &gt; The detected network communities correspond strongly with geographic and administrative boundaries, especially for the island provinces. For instance, the islands of Catanduanes and Masbate form distinct, self-contained communities that reflect their geographic separation. This correspondence is less exact on the central mainland, where the transport network is more integrated across provincial lines.</p>
<p>What are the defining geographical characteristics of the most prominent communities, and do they represent distinct sub-regions like a ‘mainland’ cluster versus an ‘island province’ cluster? &gt; The most defining geographical characteristic is the clear division of communities into a “mainland” cluster versus several “island province” clusters. The mainland features a complex patchwork of interconnected communities, indicating high integration. In contrast, island provinces like Catanduanes and Masbate form their own cohesive and geographically isolated network communities.</p>
<p>What does the identified community structure imply about the overall organization of the Bicol transport system, particularly regarding the integration or relative isolation of different parts of the region? &gt; The community structure implies that the Bicol transport system follows a “core-periphery” model of organization. The mainland peninsula acts as a highly integrated core with a dense and complex network. The island provinces function as relatively isolated peripheries with self-contained, less-developed networks that depend on limited links to the core.</p>
</section>
<section id="damage-simulation-and-efficiency-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="damage-simulation-and-efficiency-analysis">Damage Simulation and Efficiency Analysis</h2>
<p>Simulates storm impacts by removing nodes within a typhoon’s swath. Measures network performance degradation using “relief delivery efficiency,” based on changes in travel times before and after damage.</p>
<p>What specific metric was used to quantify “relief delivery efficiency,” and how is it mathematically derived from the travel times calculated before and after network damage? &gt; Relief delivery efficiency was quantified as the average of the logarithmic ratio between baseline and post-damage travel times for all delivery routes. The metric is mathematically derived using the formula <span class="math inline">\(e = \frac{1}{n} \sum \log_2(1 + T_{\text{base}}/T_{\text{new}})\)</span>, where a higher value indicates better performance. This approach effectively translates changes in travel times into a single, normalized score representing overall network integrity.</p>
<p>Which node removal strategy—targeting betweenness, degree, closeness, or random nodes—consistently resulted in the most significant drop in delivery efficiency across the various damage levels? &gt; Targeting nodes by betweenness centrality consistently caused the most significant drop in efficiency. For instance, at just 2% node damage, this strategy reduced delivery efficiency to below 0.5, while all other strategies maintained efficiency above 0.7. This demonstrates that removing the network’s primary “bridge” nodes is far more disruptive than removing hubs or other centrally located points.</p>
<p>Is there a critical damage threshold or “tipping point” evident in the results, where network efficiency begins to decline most sharply for the targeted removal strategies? &gt; A critical damage threshold is evident between 1% and 2% of node damage, where network efficiency declines most sharply. In this range, targeting high-betweenness nodes caused efficiency to plummet from approximately 0.8 down to 0.45. This “tipping point” signifies the rapid collapse of the network’s structure once a small core of its most critical nodes is compromised.</p>
<p>What do the simulation results imply about the overall resilience of the Bicol transport network, and which specific type of structural vulnerability (e.g., reliance on critical corridors, major hubs, or general connectivity) poses the greatest risk to its operational integrity during a typhoon? &gt; The simulation results imply the Bicol transport network has a brittle resilience, as its integrity collapses after only 1-2% of key nodes fail. The greatest structural vulnerability is its heavy reliance on critical corridors and “choke point” nodes connecting different regions, as their removal had the most severe impact. Therefore, the loss of these high-betweenness bridges, rather than major hubs, poses the most significant risk to the network’s operational integrity during a typhoon.</p>
</section>
<section id="critical-infrastructure-identification-and-mapping" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critical-infrastructure-identification-and-mapping">Critical Infrastructure Identification and Mapping</h2>
<p>Identifies critical transport nodes in the top 5% of betweenness centrality scores. Maps and aggregates these nodes by province and town to produce choropleth maps of their distribution.</p>
<p>What specific metric and percentile threshold were used to define ‘critical infrastructure,’ and how many total nodes in the transport network met this criterion? &gt; Critical infrastructure was defined using betweenness centrality as the metric, with a threshold set at the 95th percentile to identify the top 5% of all nodes. A total of 2,847 nodes in the transport network met this criterion, corresponding to a betweenness centrality score of approximately 0.014295 or higher.</p>
<p>What does the map of critical infrastructure reveal about the geographic distribution of these nodes, and are they clustered in specific areas or spread throughout the region? &gt; Critical nodes are highly clustered along major transport corridors. The most prominent cluster forms a central “spine” of nodes running the length of the Bicol Peninsula, while other clusters follow the main arterial and coastal roads on the island provinces of Masbate and Catanduanes. This distribution highlights the network’s dependency on a few key routes for regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Which specific provinces and municipalities contain the highest concentration of critical transport nodes, as indicated by the choropleth maps and summary tables? &gt; The provinces of Camarines Sur and Albay have the highest concentration of critical nodes, with 993 and 819 nodes, respectively. At the municipal level, Legazpi City, Masbate City, and Tabaco City contain the most critical infrastructure, with 120, 110, and 100 critical nodes each.</p>
<p>What are the practical implications of these findings for disaster risk management and infrastructure investment, particularly regarding the prioritization of network hardening and resource allocation? &gt; Disaster management should shift from a general to a highly targeted strategy focused on a small number of critical components. This includes prioritizing infrastructure investment to strengthen the transport spine in Camarines Sur and Albay, creating redundancy around key choke points, strategically pre-positioning resources, and developing evidence-based contingency routes to bypass vulnerable links.</p>
